# _tinyTimer_

_A very simple timer website with easily adjustable time. HTML/JS with a pinch of CSS and PHP._

## Installation

_Just put index.php to its own directory on a web server_ 

1. _tinyTimer loads jQuery from Google's CDN, so you need working internet connection_
2. _Just browse to the webpage with your browser. Start fullscreen mode for best results_

## Troubleshooting & Useful Tools

_By default, timer is set for two minutes, if neccessary, add a GET variable 'm' with a different amount of minutes_

> e.g.
> 
> - http://domain.com/timer/       - 2 minutes
> - http://domain.com/timer/?m=5   - 5 minutes
> - http://domain.com/timer/?m=15  - 15 minutes

_Min - 1 min. Max - 24 hours_
